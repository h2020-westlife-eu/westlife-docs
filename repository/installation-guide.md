# Installation guide \[Draft\]

There are 3 options

* Cloud installation - to install in OpenNebula, OpenStack or any other cloud computing provider.
* Local installation - using Virtual Box on local workstation or cluster for testing purposes or for private deployment.
* Development installation - same as "Local installation", but contains source code of Repository.

In order to have working ARIA integration and West-Life SSO integration you need to register your Repository instance. To do that you need fully qualified domain name at which your application is accessible within your network, it can be public \(e.g. http://myrepository.org or private http://mylocalrepository.intranet \).

Send these and other details to Instruct via [https://www.structuralbiology.eu/contact-us/](https://www.structuralbiology.eu/contact-us/)and to West-Life SSO operator
