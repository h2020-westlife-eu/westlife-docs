# Manual deployment from source codes

This procedure is appropriate for deploying into existing server or machine. E.g. within dedicated cloud infrastructure. It is recommended to use Scientific Linux 7.x, Centos 7.x or other RHEL 7.x derivatives.

Once prepared you need `git`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h2020-westlife-eu/wp6-repository.git
```
