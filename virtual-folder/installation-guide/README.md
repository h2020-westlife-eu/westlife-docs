# Installation guide

You can install Virtual Folder as an virtual machine instance, as an alternative to using it at [https://portal.west-life.eu/virtualfolder](https://portal.west-life.eu/virtualfolder).

There are 3 options

* [Cloud installation](cloud-installation.md) - to install in OpenNebula, OpenStack or any other cloud computing provider.
* [Local installation](local-installation.md) - using Virtual Box on local workstation or cluster for testing purposes or for private deployment.
* [Development installation](../../virtual-machines.md) - same as "Local installation", but contains source code of Virtual Folder. This is covered in separate section "[Virtual Machines](../../virtual-machines.md)"
