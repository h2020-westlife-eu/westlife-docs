# Adding component into Virtual Folder

* start component as a service inside Virtual Folder VM or container
* configure the proxy to redirect to the component
* Vf filesystem is at /home/vagrant/work so the external service can use it directly, webdav repositories are synchronized by davfs module, dropbox and ther are not synchronized.
