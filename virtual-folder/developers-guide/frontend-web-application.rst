Frontend - Web Application
==========================

The source codes of frontend components are at
https://github.com/h2020-westlife-eu/west-life-wp6/tree/master/wp6-virtualfolder/www

Following Chapter 6. Section 1. Step 4. the sources will be in
``/vagrant/west-life-wp6/wp6-virtualfolder/www``

Frontend application is based on HTML (5) and Javascript (Ecmascript
version 6) uses aurelia framework to

-  handle http communication
-  bundle component into vendor-bundle.js and app-bundle.js and
   transpile it to ES5 - compatible Javascript implementation in most
   web browsers in the year 2017.
-  maintain source code and use best practices/patterns to
   compose/configure the parts together

To use/integrate the components see [[Embedding components guide]]

To develop/maintain the components, the following procedure is
recommended:

1. restore npm modules

``text    npm install``

2. install aurelia-cli - globally

``text    sudo npm install aurelia-cli -g``

3. run ``au run --watch``, if some dependencies are not met - install
   the module using ``npm install <module-name>``

Adding static content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add static content into West-life VF web UI, commit it to directory
``wp6-virtualfolder/www``. Apache server on the portal and on custom VM
is by default configured with `SSI (Server Side
Include) <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/ssi.html>`__
module. The ``header.html`` and ``footer.html`` can be included into
other html. To add new HTML page:

-  add ``your.html`` and all relevant content (JS,CSS) into
   ``wp6-virtualfolder/www`` and it's subdirectories:
-  edit ``your.html`` and

include w3.css styles and other relevant styles and scripts

``text   <head>   ...   <!--#include file="heads.html" -->   ...   </head>``

include header of the pages shared among all of them, add this line up
to the html content of ``your.html``:

``text   <body>   <!--#include file="header.html" -->   ...   </body>``

(Optionaly) include footer, add this line bottom to the html content of
``your.html``:

.. code:: text

    <!--#include file="footer.html" -->
    </body>

-  edit ``header.html`` to contain link into your new page.

add e.g. following row into desirable place of the menu

``text   <li>   <a href="your.html">Your Service</a></li>``

virtualfoldersettings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  List of configured providers - component aliastable
-  Configure new provider - component genericcontrol - lists available
   providers
-  Three providers supported - FileSystem(mounted folder),Dropbox(Oauth
   or securetoken),B2Drop(username password), the same for backend web
   service
-  After adding - the list of configured providers is updated
-  If returned from dropbox auth url - the url contains access\_token -
   reopens the dropbox add dialog with securetoken readonly.
-  can add multiple instances of same provider: Dropbox (dropbox\_1,
   dropbox\_2) ...
-  cannot add multiple instances of these providers: B2Drop, it is
   manageable by modifying shell scripts

filemanager
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Two panels
-  List of files and directories
-  first level - list of aliases - virtual folders leading to the
   providers
-  second level - list of files under the root of the file provider, ...
-  Click on directory
-  go into directory
-  go up (if directory is ..)
-  Click on file
-  PDB file, triggers action to view the pdb file on the opposite panel
-  on (non-webdav provider) (Dropbox), the file is downloaded first to
   virtual folder server -

   HTTP 302 redirect is returned to webdav pointing to the location of
   the file on the virtual folder server.

-  if such file is clicked again in future - local copy on virtual
   folder server is viewed
-  issue if the file is changed on Dropbox provider.
-  on (webdav provider) (B2DROP), the file is processed by davfs -
   cached locally, cache is updated if the file is changed on B2DROP
